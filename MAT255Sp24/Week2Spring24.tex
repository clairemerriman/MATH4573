\subsection{Division Algorithm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Section 1.1 introduces the division algorithm, which will come up repeatedly throughout the semester, as well as the definition of divisors from last class.

\begin{thm}[The Division Algorithm, Theorem 1.4]\label{division-alg}
 Let $a,b\in\Z$ with $b>0$. Then there exists a unique $q,r\in\Z$ such that \[a=bq+r, \quad 0\leq r <b.\]
\end{thm}

Before proving this theorem, let's think about division with remainders, ie long division. The quotient $q$ should be the largest integer such that $bq\leq a$. If we divide both sides by $b$, we have $q\leq\frac{a}{b}$. We have a function to find the greatest integer less than or equal to $\frac{a}{b},$ namely $q=\left\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\right\rfloor$. If we rearrange the equation $a=bq+r,$ we gave $r=a-bq$. This is our scratch work for existence.

\begin{proof} Let $a,b\in\Z$ with $b>0$.
Define $q=\left\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\right\rfloor$ and $r=a-b\left\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\right\rfloor$. Then $a=bq+r$ by rearranging the equation. 
Now we need to show $0\leq r<b$. 

Since $x-1<\lfloor x\rfloor\leq x$ by Lemma 1.3, we have \[\frac{a}{b}-1<\left\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\right\rfloor\leq\frac{a}{b}.\] 
Multiplying all terms by $-b$, we get 
 \[-a+b>-b\left\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\right\rfloor\geq-a.\]
 Adding $a$ to every term gives \[b>a-b\left\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\right\rfloor\geq 0.\] 
By the definition of $r$, we have shown $0\leq r <b$.

Finally, we need to show that $q$ and $r$ are unique.
Assume there exist $q_1,q_2,r_1,r_2\in\Z$ with \[a=bq_1+r_1, \quad 0\leq r_1<b\]
 \[a=bq_2+r_2, \quad 0\leq r_2<b.\]
 We need to show $q_1=q_2$ and $r_1=r_2$. We can subtract the two equations from each other. 
 
\begin{align*}
  a&=bq_1+r_1, \\
\underline{ -(a}&\underline{=bq_2+r_2)}, \\
 0&=bq_1+r_1-bq_2-r_2=b(q_1-q_2)+(r_1-r_2) . 
\end{align*}

Rearranging, we get $b(q_1-q_2)=r_2-r_1$. Thus, $b\mid r_2-r_1$. From rearranging the inequalities:
\begin{align*}
 & 0\leq r_2<b\\
- & \underline{b< -r_1\leq 0}\\
 -&b<r_2-r_1<b.
\end{align*}
Thus, the only way $b\mid r_2-r_1$ is that $r_2-r_1=0$ and thus $r_1=r_2$. Now, $0=b(q_1-q_2)+(r_1-r_2)$ becomes $0=b(q_1-q_2)$. Since we assumed $b>0$, we have that $q_1-q_2=0$. 
\end{proof}



\begin{br}
 Use the division algorithm on $a=47, b=6$ and $a=281, b=13$.
\end{br}
\begin{solution}
For $a=47, b=6$, we have that $a=(7)6+5, q=7, r=5$.
For $a=281, b=13$, we have that $a=(21)13+8, q=21, r=8$.
\end{solution}

\begin{cor}\label{div-alg-neg}
 Let $a,b\in\Z$ with $b\neq0$. Then there exists a unique $q,r\in\Z$ such that \[a=bq+r, \quad 0\leq r <|b|.\]
\end{cor}
One proof method is using an existing proof as a guide.

\begin{br} [Exercise Set 1.1, Exercise 15a] Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero integers. Prove that there exists a unique $q,r\in\Z$ such that 
  \[a=bq+r, \quad 0\leq r <|b|.\]
%(Outline updated from class)
  \begin{enumerate}
    	\item Use the Division Algorithm to prove this statement as a corollary. That is, use the \emph{conclusion} of the Division Algorithm as part of the proof.  Use the following outline:
    	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero integers. Since $|b|>0$, the division algorithm says that there exist unique $p,s\in\Z$ such that $\answer{a=p|b|+s}$ and $\answer{0\leq s<|b|}$.
      		\item There are two cases:
      		\begin{enumerate}
        			\item When $\answer{b>0}$, the conditions are already met and $\answer{r=s$ and $q=p}$.
        			\item Otherwise, $\answer{b<0}$, $r=\answer{s}$ and $q=\answer{-b}$.
      		\end{enumerate}
      		\item Since both cases used that the $p,s$ are unique, then $q,r$ are also unique
	\end{enumerate}
    	\item Use the \emph{proof} of the Division Algorithm as a template to prove this statement. That is, repeat the steps, adjusting as necessary, but do not use the conclusion.
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item In the proof of the Division Algorithm, we let $q=\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\rfloor$. Here we have two cases:
    		\begin{enumerate}
      			\item When $\answer{b>0}$, $q=\answer{\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\rfloor}$ and $r=\answer{a-bq}.$
      			\item When $\answer{b<0}$, $q=\answer{-\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\rfloor}$ and $r=\answer{a-bq}.$   
		\end{enumerate}
    		\item Follow the steps of the \emph{proof} of the Division Algorithm to finish the proof.
    	\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Primes}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{defn}
An integer $p>1$ is \emph{prime} if the only positive divisors of $p$ are $1$ and itself. An integer $n$ which is not prime is \emph{composite}. 
\end{defn}

Why is $1$ not prime?


\begin{lem*}[Lemma 1.5]\label{lem-exist-prime-divisor}
 Every integer greater than 1 has a prime divisor.
\end{lem*}

We will not go over this proof in class.

\begin{proof} 
 Assume by contradiction that there exists $n\in\Z$ greater than 1 with no prime divisor. By the well ordering principle, we may assume $n$ is the least such integer. By definition, $n\mid n$, so $n$ is not prime. Thus, $n$ is composite and there exists $a,b\in\Z$ such that $n=ab$ and $1<a<n$, $1<b<n$. Since $a<n$, then it has a prime divisor $p$. But since $p\mid a$ and $p\mid n$, $p\mid n$. This contradicts our assumption, so no such integer exists.
\end{proof}


\begin{thm}[Euclid's Infinitude of Primes, Theorem 1.6]\label{infinite-primes}
 There are infinitely many prime numbers.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
 Assume by way of contradiction, that there are only finitely many prime numbers, so $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$. Consider the number $N=p_1p_2\cdots p_n +1$. Now $N$ has a prime divisor, say, $p$, by Lemma 1.5. So $p=p_i$ for some $i$, $i=1,2,\dots,n$. Then $p\mid N-p_1p_2\dots p_n$, which implies that $p\mid 1$, a contradiction. Hence, there are infinitely many prime numbers.
\end{proof}

Another important fact is there are arbitrarily large sequences of composite numbers. Put another way, there are arbitrarily large gaps in the primes. Another important proof method, which is a \emph{constructive proof}:

\begin{prop*}[Proposition 1.8]\label{aribitrary-gaps-primes}
 For any positive integer $n$, there are at least $n$ consecutive positive integers.
\end{prop*}
\begin{proof}
 Given the positive integer $n$, consider the $n$ consecutive positive integers \[(n+1)!+2, (n+1)!+3,\dots, (n+1)!+n+1.\]
 Let $i$ be a positive integer such that $2\leq i\leq n+1$. Since $i\mid (n+1)!$ and $i\mid i$, we have \[i\mid(n+1)! +i,\quad 2\leq i\leq n+1\] by Proposition 1.2. So each of the $n$ consecutive positive integers is composite.
\end{proof}

  \begin{br} Let $n$ be a positive integer with $n\neq 1$. Prove that if $n^2+1$ is prime, then $n^2+1$ can be written in the form $4k+1$ with $k\in\Z$.
  \begin{solution}
   Assume that $n$ is a positive integer, $n\neq 1,$ and $n^2+1$ is prime. If $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd, which would imply $n^2+1=2,$ the only even prime. However, $n\neq 1$ by assumption. Thus, $n$ is even. 

    By definition of even, there exists $j\in\Z$ such that $n=2k$ and $n^2=4j^2$. Thus, $n^2+1=4k+1$ when $k=j^2.$
  \end{solution}
\end{br}

  \begin{br}
  Prove or disprove the following conjecture, which is similar to Conjecture 1:\\
      \textbf{Conjecture:} There are infinitely many prime number $p$ for which $p+2$ and $p+4$ are also prime numbers.

  
  \begin{solution}
    On Homework 2.

\subsection{Greatest common divisor} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{defn} If $a\mid b$ and $a\mid c$ then $a$ is a \emph{common divisor} of $b$ and $c$.

 If at least one of $b$ and $c$ is not $0$, the greatest (positive) number among their common divisors  is called the \emph{greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$} and is denoted $gcd(a,b)$ or just $(a,b)$. 
 
 If $gcd(a,b)=1$, we say that $a$ and $b$ are \emph{relatively prime}.

If we want the greatest common divisor of several integers at once we denote that by $\gcd(b_1,b_2,b_3,\dots,b_n)$.
\end{defn}

For example, $\gcd(4,8)$ is $4$ but $\gcd(4,6,8)$ is $2$.

The GCD always exists when at least one of the integers is nonzero. How to show this: $1$ is always a divisor, and no divisor can be larger than the maximum of $|a|,|b|$. So there is a finite number of divisors, thus there is a maximum.


\begin{prop}[B\'ezout's Identify, Proposition 1.11]\label{bezout-id}
 Let $a, b\in \Z$ with $a$ and $b$ not both zero. Then 
 \[\{(a,b)=\min\{ma+nb:m,n\in\Z, ma+nb>0\}.\]
\end{prop}
This proof brings together definitions (of gcd), previous results (division algorithm, factors of linear combinationd), the well-ordering principle, and some methods for minimum and maximum/greatest.
\begin{proof}
 Since $a,b\in\Z$ are not both zero, at least one of $1a+0b, -1a+0b, 0a+1b, 0a+(-1)b$ is in $\{ma+nb:m,n\in\Z, ma+nb>0\}$. Therefore, the set is nonempty and has a minimal element by the well-ordering principle. Call this element $d$, and $d=xa+yb$ for some $x,y\in \Z$.
 
First we will show that $d\mid a$. By the division algorithm, there exist unique $q,r\in\Z$ such that $a=qd+r$ with $0\leq r<d$. Then, \[r=a-qd=a-q(xa+yb)=(1-qx)a-qyb,\] so $r$ is an integral linear combination of $a$ and $b$.  Since $d$ is the least positive such integer, $r=0$ and $d\mid a$. Similarly, $d\mid b$. 

It remains to show that $d$ is the \emph{greatest} common divisor of $a$ and$b$. Let $c$be any common divisor of $a$  and $b$. Then $c\mid ax+by=d$, so $c\mid d$.
\end{proof}

Since we assume $a$ and $b$ are not both zero, we could also simplify the first sentence using \emph{without loss of generality}. Since there is no difference between $a$ and $b$, we can assume $a\neq0$.
