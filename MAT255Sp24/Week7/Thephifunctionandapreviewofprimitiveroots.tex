We will use \autoref{br:multiplicative-proof} as an outline to prove 

\begin{thm*}[Theorem 3.2]\label{thm:phi-multiplicative}
  Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers where $(m,n)=1$. Then $\phi(mn)=\phi(m)\phi(n).$
\end{thm*}
maybe works?

\begin{proof} 
  First, we note that an integer $a$ is relatively prime to $mn$ if and only if it is relatively prime to $m$ and $n,$ since $m$ and $n$ (together) have the same prime divisors as $mn$.

  
  We can partition the positive integers less that $mn$ into 
    \begin{alignat*}{8}
      &0  & \equiv & m  & \equiv & 2m & \equiv &\cdots  & \equiv & (n-1)m\pmod{m}\\
      &1  & \equiv & m + 1  & \equiv & 2m + 1 & \equiv &\cdots  & \equiv & (n-1)m + 1\pmod{m}\\
      &2  & \equiv & m + 2  & \equiv & 2m + 2 & \equiv & \cdots  & \equiv & (n-1)m + 2\pmod{m}\\
      & \vdots & & \vdots& & \vdots & & & &  \vdots\\
      &m-1  & \equiv & 2m - 1  & \equiv & 3m -1 & \equiv & \cdots  & \equiv & nm - 1\pmod{m}
    \end{alignat*}
 
    For any $b$ in the range $0,1,2,\dots,m-1$, define $s_b$ to be the number of integers $a$ in the range $0,1,2,\dots, mn-1$ such that $a\equiv b \pmod{m}$ and $\gcd(a,mn)=1$. For each equivalence class $b,$ $\gcd(b,m)\mid km +b$ by linear combination. Thus, $s_b={0}$ if $(b,m)>1.$ If $\gcd(b,m)=1$, the arithmetic progression, \{b, m + b, 2m + b, \dots, (n-1)m+ b\} contains $n$ elements. By \autoref{br:arithmetic-progression}, the arithmetic progression is a \nameref{defn:complete-residue} modulo $n,$ so $\phi(n)$ elements are relatively prime to $n$ and thus $mn.$
 
    Thus, can see that when $(b,m)=1$, $s_b=\phi(n)$ and when $(b,m)>1$, $s_b={0}$.
 
    Since all of the positive integers less than or equal to $mn$ is in exactly one of the congruence classes above and t he $s_i$ count how many integers in each congruence class are relatively prime to $mn$, $phi(mn)=s_0+s_1+\cdots +s_{m-1}.$
 
    Since $\phi(m)$ of the $s_i=\phi(n)$ and the rest are 0, $\phi(mn)=s_0+s_1+\cdots +s_{m-1}=\phi(m)\phi(n).$
 
\end{proof}


\begin{br}\label{br:arithmetic-progression}
  Complete the proof of \nameref{thm:phi-multiplicative} by proving that, if $m, n,$ and $i$ are positive integers with ($m, n) = (m, i) = 1,$ then the integers $i, m + i, 2m +i,..., (n - 1)m +i$ form a complete system of residues modulo $n.$
