Modular arithmetic and congruences modulo $m$ generalize the concept of even and odd. We typically think of even and odd as ``divisible by 2'' and ``not divisible by 2'', but often a more useful interpretation is even means ``there is a remainder of $0$ divided by 2'' and ``there is a remainder of 1 when divided by 2''.
This interpretation gives us more flexibility when replacing $2$ by $3$ or larger numbers. Instead of ``divisible'' or ``not divisible'' we have several gradations.

There's two major reasons. One is that, calculations are much simplier using modular arithmetic. We'll see later that taking MASSIVE powers of MASSIVE numbers is a fairly doable feat in modular arithmetic. The second reason is that by reducing a question from all integers to modular arithmetic, we often have an easier time seeing what solutions are not allowed.
