Strayer Exercise Set 1.3, Exercises 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 51. Exercises 38, 39, and 40 will be graded as one problem. 
The generalized version of Lemmas from class on Friday are exercises immediately before Exercise 51.
Strayer Exercise Set 1.5, Exercise 83, also on Paper 1.
Strayer Exercise Set 6.1, Exercise 8.

\begin{ex}[Strayer Chapter 1, Exercise 36]
 	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] %enumerate creates a numbered list, label=(\alph*) says to use lower case numbers in parentheses
		\item Do there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x + y = 100$ and $(x, y) = 8$?

		\item Prove that there exist infinitely many pairs of integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x + y = 87$ and $(x, y) = 3$.
