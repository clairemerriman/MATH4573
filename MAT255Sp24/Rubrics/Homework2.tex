\begin{ex}[Strayer Exercise 7]
 Let $a, b \in\Z$ with $a\mid b$. Prove that $a^n\mid b^n$ for every positive integer $n$.
\end{ex}

\begin{writeRubric}
    \item \textbf{Does not demonstrate understanding}
     Contains a reasonable attempt to prove each part, but does not meet the criteria for two points.
    \item \textbf{Needs revisions}
     
    \item \textbf{Demonstrates understanding}
    
    \item \textbf{Exemplary}

\begin{ex}[Strayer Exercise 9]
 Let $a, m$ and $n$ be positive integers with $a >1$ Prove that $a^m-1\mid a^n-1$ if and only if $m\mid n.$ (\emph{Hint:} For the ``if" direction, write $n= md$ with $d$ a positive integer and use the factorization $a^{md} d - 1= (a^m - 1) \times  (a^{m(d-1)} + a^{m(d-2)} +\cdot + a^m + 1).$]

\begin{ex}[Strayer Exercise 15] The following exercises present two alternative versions of the division algorithm. Both versions allow negative divisors; as such, they are more general than Theorem 1.4
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item\label{abs_value_divide} Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero integers. Prove that there exists a unique $q,r\in\Z$ such that 
		\[a=bq+r, \quad 0\leq r <|b|.\]
		\item Find the unique $q$ and $r$ guarenteed by the division algorithm of part \ref{abs_value_divide} above with $a=47$ and $b=-6$.
		\item\label{least_remain} Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero integers. Prove that there exist unique $q,r\in\Z$ such that 
		\[a=bq+r,\quad -\frac{|b|}{2}<r\leq \frac{|b|}{2}.\] 
		This algorithm is called the \emph{absolute least remainders algorithm}.
		\item Find the unique $q$ and $r$ guarenteed by the division algorithm of part \ref{least_remain} above with $a=47$ and $b=-6$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[Strayer Exercise 23] Prove or disprove the following conjecture, which is similar to Conjecture 1:
		\textbf{Conjecture:} There are infinitely many prime number $p$ for which $p+2$ and $p+4$ are also prime numbers.

\begin{ex}[Ernst Problem 2.50]
Consider the following statement: If $x\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $x^2$ is odd, then $x$ is odd.
The items below can be assembled to form a proof of this statement, but they are currently out of order.  Put them in the proper order.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Assume that $x$ is an even integer.
	\item We will utilize a proof by contraposition.
	\item Thus, $x^2$ is twice an integer.
	\item Since $x=2k$, we have that $x^2 =(2k)^2 =4k^2$.
	\item Since $k$ is an integer, $2k^2$ is also an integer.
	\item By the definition of even, there is an integer $k$ such that $x=2k$.
	\item We have proved the contrapositive, and hence the desired statement is true.
	\item Assume $x\in \mathbb{Z}$.
	\item By the definition of even integer, $x^2$ is an even integer.
	\item Notice that $x^2 = 2(2k^2)$.
\end{enumerate}
