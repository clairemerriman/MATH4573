\begin{problem}[Strayer Chapter 1, Exercise 5]\label{ch1-ex5}%
    Prove or disprove the following statements.%
            \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item If \(a,b,c,\) and \(d\) are integers such that \(a\mid b\) and \(c\mid d\), then \(a+c\mid b+d\).%
            \item If \(a,b,c,\) and \(d\) are integers such that \(a\mid b\) and \(c\mid d\), then \(ac\mid bd\).%
            \item If \(a,b,\) and \(c\) are integers such that \(a\nmid b\) and \(b\nmid c\), then \(a\nmid c\).enumerate%
    \end{enumerate}
%
    
    \begin{solution}
         \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item False: Let \(a=b=c=1\) and \(d=2\). Then \(a+b=2\) and \(c+d=3\). Therefore, \(a+b\nmid c+d\).%
            \item Let \(a,b,c,\) and \(d\) be integers such that \(a\mid b\) and \(c\mid d\). Then there exists \(m,n\in\Z\) such that \(a=bm\) and \(c=dn\), by \hyperref[def-divides]{definition of divides}. Multiplying these two equations gives \[ac=(bm)(dn)=(bd)(mn).\]  Therefore, \(ac\mid bd\).%
            \item False: Let \(a=2, b=3,\) and \(c=4\). Then \(a\nmid b, b\nmid c\) and \(a\mid c\).
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}

\begin{problem}[Strayer Chapter 1, Exercise 10]\label{ch1-ex10}%
%
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Let \(n\in\Z\). Prove that \(3\mid n^3-n\).%
            \item Let \(n\in\Z\). Prove that \(5\mid n^5-n\).%
            \item Let \(n\in\Z\). Is it true that \(4\mid n^4-n\)? Provide a proof or counter example.enumerate%
    \end{enumerate}
%
    \begin{proof}
    There are several ways to do these problems. I used slightly different methods for parts (a) and (b).%
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Let \(n\in\Z\). Then \(n^3-n=\). By the Division Algorithm, there exists unique \(q,r\in\Z\) such that \(n=3q+r\) and \(0\leq r<3\).  Thus, \(n^3-n=27q^3+27q^2r+9qr^2+r^3-3q-r\)%

            If \(r=0\), then \(n^3-n=27q^3-3q=3(9q^3-q)\), so\(3\mid n^3-n.\)%

            If \(r=1\), then \(n^3-n=27q^3+27q^2+6q=3(9q^3+9q^2+2q)\), so\(3\mid n^3-n.\)%

            If \(r=2\), then \(n^3-n=27q^3+54q^2+15q+6=3(9q^3+18q^2+5q+2)\), so\(3\mid n^3-n.\)%

            Therefore, \(3\mid n^3-n\) in all possible cases.%
            
            \item Let \(n\in\Z\). Then \(n^5-n=n(n-1)(n+1)(n^2+1)\). By the Division Algorithm, there exists unique \(q,r\in\Z\) such that \(n=5q+r\) and \(0\leq r<5\).%

            If \(r=0\), then \(5\mid n.\) If \(r=1\), then \(5\mid (n-1)=5q\). If \(r=4\), then \(5\mid (n+1)=5q\).%

            If \(r=2\), then \(n=5q+2\) and \(n^2+1=25q^2+20q+4+1=5(5q^2+4q+1)\). Therefore, \(5\mid (n^2+1)\). If \(r=3\), then \(n=5q+3\) and \(n^2+1=25q^2+30q+9+1=5(5q^2+6q+2)\). Therefore, \(5\mid (n^2+1)\). Thus, by transitivity of division, \(5\mid n^5-n\).%
            
            \item False: Let \(n=2\). Then \(n^4-n=14\) and \(4\nmid 14\).%
        \end{enumerate}
%
    \end{proof}


    The hint in the back of the book says to use induction for part (a). That is not necessary and likely harder.%

        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\begin{problem}\label{hw-tf}%
For each of the following equation, find what real numbers \(x\)  make the statement true. Prove your statement.%
    \begin{enumerate}
            \item \( \lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor x \rfloor =\lfloor 2x\rfloor\)%
            \item \( \lfloor x + 3 \rfloor  = 3 +\lfloor x\rfloor\)%
            \item \( \lfloor x +3 \rfloor = 	3 + x\)%
    \end{enumerate}
%
    \begin{solution}
    All of these statements could be stated as ``if and only if." The proofs below also work for both directions of the biconditional.%
%
    \begin{enumerate}
            \item If the decimal part of \(x\) is less than 0.5, then \(\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor x \rfloor =\lfloor 2x\rfloor\) . In otherwords, if \(x-\frac{1}{2} < \lfloor x \rfloor\leq x\), then \(\lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor x \rfloor =\lfloor 2x\rfloor\) .
            
                \begin{proof}
                We will use the characterization \(x-\frac{1}{2} < \lfloor x \rfloor\leq x\). Then we add this inequality to itself to find%
                    \begin{align*}
                        x-\frac{1}{2}+x-\frac{1}{2} &   
                        < \lfloor x \rfloor +\lfloor x \rfloor\leq x + x\\
                        2x-1 &   
                        < \lfloor x \rfloor +\lfloor x \rfloor\leq 2x. 
                    \end{align*}
                By \hyperref[lem-floor]{Strayer, Lemma 1.3}, \(2x-1 < \lfloor 2x \rfloor \leq 2x.\) Since the characterizations are the same, it must be that \(\lfloor x \rfloor +\lfloor x \rfloor=\lfloor 2x \rfloor .\)%
                \end{proof}
                %
            \item If \(x\in\R\), then \(\lfloor x + 3 \rfloor  = 3 +\lfloor x\rfloor\). 
            \begin{proof}
                By \hyperref[lem-floor]{Strayer, Lemma 1.3}, for all \(x\in\R\), \(x-1 +3 < 3 + \lfloor x \rfloor \leq x + 3\) and \(x + 2 < \lfloor x + 3 \rfloor \leq x +3 \). That is, \(3 + \lfloor x \rfloor= \lfloor x +3 \rfloor\).%
            \end{proof}
                %
            \item If \(x\in\Z\), then \(\lfloor x +3 \rfloor = 	3 + x\)  
            \begin{proof}
                Since \(\lfloor x +3 \rfloor \in \Z,\) \(\lfloor x +3 \rfloor = 	3 + x\) requires \(x\in\Z\). By part (b), \(\lfloor x + 3 \rfloor  = 3 +\lfloor x\rfloor\) for all \(x\in\Z\).%
            \end{proof}
                %
        \end{enumerate}
