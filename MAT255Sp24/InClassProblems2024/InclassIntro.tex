Most of these problems can also be found throughout the course notes, often with less scaffolding. Since the Davidson College Number Theory course can serve as an introduction to proofs, many of the worksheets focus on proof solving skills, including using other proofs as a model, fill-in-the-blank reminders to justify reasoning, and examples of multiple proof methods for the same statement.
 
 Since I anticipate these files would be highly modified by anyone teaching the course, I have also included references to \emph{Elementary Number Theory} by James K. Strayer throughout the worksheets.
