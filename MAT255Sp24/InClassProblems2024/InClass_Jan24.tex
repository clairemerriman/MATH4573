\begin{br}[Chapter 1, Exercise 29]
    Let $n$ be a positive integer with $n\neq 1$. Prove that if $n^2+1$ is prime, then $n^2+1$ can be written in the form $4k+1$ with $k\in\Z$.


    \begin{hint}
        Try showing the statement is true for all odd integers greater than $1.$
    \end{hint}

    \begin{solution}
        Assume that $n$ is a positive integer, $n\neq 1,$ and $n^2+1$ is prime. If $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd, which would imply $n^2+1=2,$ the only even prime. However, $n\neq 1$ by assumption. Thus, $n$ is even. 

        By definition of even, there exists $j\in\Z$ such that $n=2k$ and $n^2=4j^2$. Thus, $n^2+1=4k+1$ when $k=j^2.$
    \end{solution}

\begin{br}[Chapter 1, Exercise 33]
    Prove or disprove the following conjecture, which is similar to the Twin Prime Conjecture:
    \begin{conjecture}
        There are infinitely many prime number $p$ for which $p+2$ and $p+4$ are also prime numbers.
    \end{conjecture}


    \begin{hint}
        Show that the only prime where $p+2$ and $p+4$ are also prime is $p=3.$ 
    \end{hint}

    Without looking up the proof, prove 
    Proposition 1.10:
    Let $a, b\in \Z$ with $(a,b)=d.$ Then $\left(\frac{a}{d},\frac{b}{d}\right)=1.$
