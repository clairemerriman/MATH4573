\begin{defn}[greatest common divisor]\label{defn:gcd} 
  If $a\mid b$ and $a\mid c$ then $a$ is a \emph{common divisor} of $b$ and $c$.

  If at least one of $b$ and $c$ is not $0$, the greatest (positive) number among their common divisors  is called the \emph{greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$} and is denoted $gcd(a,b)$ or just $(a,b)$. 
 
  If $gcd(a,b)=1$, we say that $a$ and $b$ are \emph{relatively prime}.

  If we want the greatest common divisor of several integers at once we denote that by $\gcd(b_1,b_2,b_3,\dots,b_n)$.
\end{defn}

For example, $\gcd(4,8)$ is $4$ but $\gcd(4,6,8)$ is $2$.

The GCD always exists when at least one of the integers is nonzero. How to show this: $1$ is always a divisor, and no divisor can be larger than the maximum of $|a|,|b|$. So there is a finite number of divisors, thus there is a maximum.


\begin{prop*}[B\'ezout's Identity]\label{Bezout}
  Let $a, b\in \Z$ with $a$ and $b$ not both zero. Then 
    \[\{(a,b)=\min\{ma+nb:m,n\in\Z, ma+nb>0\}.\]
\end{prop*}
This proof brings together definitions (of gcd), previous results (\nameref{div-alg}, factors of linear combinations), the well-ordering principle, and some methods for minimum and maximum/greatest.

\begin{proof}
  Since $a,b\in\Z$ are not both zero, at least one of $1a+0b, -1a+0b, 0a+1b, 0a+(-1)b$ is in $\{ma+nb:m,n\in\Z, ma+nb>0\}$. Therefore, the set is nonempty and has a minimal element by the \nameref{well-order}. Call this element $d$, and $d=xa+yb$ for some $x,y\in \Z$.
 
  First we will show that $d\mid a$. By the \nameref{div-alg}, there exist unique $q,r\in\Z$ such that $a=qd+r$ with $0\leq r<d$. Then, \[r=a-qd=a-q(xa+yb)=(1-qx)a-qyb,\] so $r$ is an integral linear combination of $a$ and $b$.  Since $d$ is the least positive such integer, $r=0$ and $d\mid a$. Similarly, $d\mid b$. 

  It remains to show that $d$ is the \emph{greatest} common divisor of $a$ and$b$. Let $c$be any common divisor of $a$  and $b$. Then $c\mid ax+by=d$, so $c\mid d$.
\end{proof}

Since we assume $a$ and $b$ are not both zero, we could also simplify the first sentence using \emph{without loss of generality}. Since there is no difference between $a$ and $b$, we can assume $a\neq0$.
