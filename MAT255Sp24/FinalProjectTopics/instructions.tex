\maketitle
Attendance for each of the presentations is mandatory. 

You may present individually or in pairs. Individual presentations should be 15-20 minutes and pair presentations should be 20-30 minutes. All presentations are on the whiteboard, although you may write on a tablet/slides if you check the technology ahead of time (and be prepared for it to not cooperate). You can have notes with you, and you may rely on them similar to how reliant I am on mine during lectures. But you should prepare this presentation enough that you arenâ€™t always directly copying your notes.

Submit your ranking of choices by the start of class on April 24. If you choose to work with a partner, only one person has to submit the rankings. I will send out the project assignments after class on Wednesday.

I encourage you to ask for help leading up to the presentation practice your presentation for time and accuracy, including presenting on the board.
