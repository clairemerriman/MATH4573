\begin{rem}\label{remark-add-inverse}
Let $a,b,m\in\Z$ with $m>0$. Every row/column of addition modulo $m$ contains $\{0,1,\dots,m-1\}$. 

We can also say that $a+x\equiv b\pmod m$ always has a solution, since $x\equiv b-a\pmod m$.

\begin{thm*}[Strayer Theorem 2.6 and Porism 2.7]\label{thm:lin-cong-solutions}
Let $a,b,m\in\Z$ with $m>0,$ and $d=(a,m)$. The linear congruence in one variable $ax\equiv b\pmod m$ has a solution if and only if $d\mid b$. When $d\mid b,$ there are exactly $d$ incongruent solutions modulo $m$ corresponding to the congruence classes \[x_0, x_0+\frac{m}{d},\dots,x_0+\frac{(d-1)m}{d} \pmod m.\]
\end{thm*}
\begin{proof}
 Let $a,b,m\in\Z$ with $m>0$, and $d=(a,m)$. From the definition of congruence modulo $m$, $ax\equiv b \pmod m$ if and only if $m\mid (ax-b)$. That is, $ax\equiv b \pmod m$ if and only if $my=ax-b$ for some $y\in\Z$ from the definition of divisibility. Sine $ax-my=b$ is a linear Diophantine equation, \nameref{thm:linear-dioph} says solutions exist if and only if $(a,-m)=d\mid b.$
 
In the case that solutions exist, let $x_0, y_0$ be a particular solution to the linear Diophantine equation. Then $x_0$ is also a solution to the linear congruence in one variable, since $a x_0-my_0=b,$ implies $ax_0\equiv b\pmod m$. From \nameref{thm:linear-dioph}, all solutions have the from $x=x_0+\frac{mn}{d}$ for all $n\in\Z.$  We need to show that these solutions are in exactly $d$ distinct congruence classes modulo $m.$
 
Consider the solutions $x_0+\frac{mi}{d}$ and $x_0+\frac{mj}{d}$ for some integers $i$ and $j.$ Then $x_0+\frac{mj}{d}\equiv x_0+\frac{mk}{d} \pmod m$ if and only if $m\mid \left(\frac{mi}{d}-\frac{mj}{d}\right).$ That is, if and only if there exists $k\in\Z$ such that $mk=\frac{mi}{d}-\frac{mj}{d}$. Rearranging this equation, we get that $x_0+\frac{mj}{d}\equiv x_0+\frac{mk}{d} \pmod m$ if and only if $dk=i-j.$ Thus, $i\equiv j\pmod$ by definition of equivalence modulo $d.$ Thus, the incongruent solutions to $ax\equiv b\pmod m$ are the congruence classes \[x_0, x_0+\frac{m}{d},\dots,x_0+\frac{(d-1)m}{d} \pmod m.\qedhere\]
\end{proof}

\begin{example} Let's consider several linear congruences modulo $12.$
\begin{itemize}
\item The linear congruence $2x\equiv 1\pmod{12}$ has no solutions, since $2\nmid1.$
\item The linear congruence $8x\equiv b \pmod{12}$ has a solution if and only if $4\mid b$. Considering the least nonnegative residues, the options for $b$ are:
	\begin{itemize}
 	\item $8x\equiv 0\pmod{12}.$ The incongruent solutions are $0,3,6,9\pmod{12}.$
	\item $8x\equiv 4\pmod{12}.$ The incongruent solutions are $2,5,8,11\pmod{12}.$ Notice we cannot divide across the equivalence, since $2x\equiv 1\pmod{12}$ has no solutions. 
	\item $8x\equiv 8\pmod{12}.$ The incongruent solutions are $1,4,7,10\pmod{12}.$ 
	\end{itemize}
 \item The linear congruence $5x\equiv 1 \pmod{12}$ has solution $x\equiv 5\pmod{12}.$ Since $(5,12)=1,$ the solution is unique.
 \item The linear congruence $5x\equiv 7 \pmod{12}$ has solution $x\equiv -1\equiv 11\pmod{12}.$ Since $(5,12)=1,$ the solution is unique. Note that instead of $12+5(-1)=7,$ we could have done \[5(5x)\equiv 5(7)\equiv 11\pmod{12}.\]
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
