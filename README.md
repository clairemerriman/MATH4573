# MATH 4573

Elementary number theory course at Ohio State: upper level elective, has introduction to proofs as a prerequiste, covers groups/rings/fields

## Spring 2020

The PDF of notes from the first 8 weeks of Spring 2020 is SemesterNotesInPerson2020.pdf, 
while the tex files and PDF for the last 5 weeks are in the MATH4573Online folder. Online version is at https://ximera.osu.edu/math4573

Used Niven-Zuckerman-Montgomery, at least until the move online. 
Pulled from many sources followed for the online notes except for continued fractions (my research area) and Farey fractions (from NZM).
Primitive roots (in person) did take readings from _Number Theory: A Lively Introduction with Proofs, Applications, and Stories_ by James Pommersheim, Tim Marks, Erica Flapan
which likely influenced the presentation of the proof that $\phi$ is multiplicative. 
The rest is heavily influenced by the presentations in _Elementary Number Theory_ by James K. Strayer.

## Spring 2021

Switched to _Elementary Number Theory_ by Gareth A. Jones and J. Mary Jones. Notes mix presentation from Jones \& Jones with the prentation from 2020.

Spring 2021 notes are complete, although the SemesterNotesSP2021.tex might be having compile issues.

# MAT 255

Number theory course at Davidson College which can also serve as introduction to proofs. 
Continuing to interate on the notes from the previous 4 years (Spring 2022 OSU and Spring 2023 Davidson not included in respository).

Using _Elementary Number Theory_ by James K. Strayer as the official textbook, with [An Introduction to Proof via Inquiry-Based Learning](https://danaernst.com/IBL-IntroToProof/pretext/appendix_elements_of_style.html) by Dana C. Ernst for the Introduction to proofs.
